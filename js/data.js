    bio: `Sure, Jupiter has constant hurricanes of gas and Mars may even have some frozen water … but Earth is the only planet in our solar
    system capable of creating rainbows – so far as we know. That’s because Earth is the only planet with consistent liquid precipitation and direct sunlight.`

      note: `Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface
    over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.`,
